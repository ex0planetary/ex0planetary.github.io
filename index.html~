		<h1>Hi, I'm Kaden. (Also known as ex0planetary)</h1>
		<p>I develop games and mods for games. Here's some of the stuff I've made over the years.</p>
	</header>
	
	<main>
		<h2>Minecraft Mods</h2>
		<p>From 2020-2022 I was cofounder and lead developer of the Minecraft modding team Team Aurora. Over the years we racked up <b>over 17 million total downloads</b> making vanilla-styled mods. I did almost all of the programming for our mods, on top of a decent bit of game design and managing the team.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-mushrooms">Enhanced Mushrooms</a></h3>
		<img alt="Enhanced Mushrooms screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/317/494/2020-10-19_11.png" />
		<p>Enhanced Mushrooms adds a couple new wood types obtained from Minecraft's giant mushrooms, to make them more consistent with the Nether's mushrooms/fungi which have their own wood types. I did all of the game design for this mod, as well as the vast majority of the programming.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-badlands">Better Badlands</a></h3>
		<img alt="Better Badlands screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/324/54/2020-10-17_12.png" />
		<p>Better Badlands is a small mod that adds a few features to the Badlands biome. It contains a couple of blocks with unique properties, and a new small dark oak tree. A lot of the stuff in this mod was coded by me, although other team members did most of the code for the Thatch block.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bayou-blues">Bayou Blues</a></h3>
		<img alt="Bayou Blues screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/344/670/2021-02-16_20.png" />
		<p>Bayou Blues adds a new Bayou biome to the game. Apparently it was good enough that one of the most-downloaded mods of all time took inspiration from it and reworked their Bayou biome. Pretty cool I guess. I did all of the code for this one, and actually pumped out a large portion of the mod's code in a single day!</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/abundance">Abundance</a></h3>
		<img alt="Abundance screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/344/663/2021-03-01_14.png" />
		<p>Abundance is another biome mod that adds a couple of flower-related biomes. All of the code in the current patch as of March 2022 was written by me.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fruitful">Fruitful</a></h3>
		<img alt="Fruitful screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/370/61/2021-06-07_18.png" />
		<p>Fruitful is a little mod that was designed and coded entirely by me. The only part of it that I didn't do was the artwork. It was intended as an experiment to see if I could go from a problem (apples are annoying to farm) to a mod that solved that problem.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hanami">Hanami</a></h3>
		<img alt="Hanami screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/307/879/2020-08-11_18.png" />
		<p>Hanami was a mod that added several different features based around a cherry blossom forest biome. I didn't do any of the game design for this one but I did all of the code. It was a lot of work and also is the one example I have of me coding entities! Sadly it was abandoned due to some internal strife within the team.</p>
		
		<h2>Duskbringer</h2>
		<p>Duskbringer is a standalone game I've been making since I left the Minecraft modding scene in early 2022. It's a metroidvania inspired by games such as Hollow Knight, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Breath of the Wild, and Minecraft. You play as a lizard exploring a ruined kingdom carved into a giant tree.</p>
		<p>The game is still very early in development, and all the artwork is currently temporary, but here's an early screenshot:</p>

		<h2>More to come</h2>
		<p>I love programming and I'm often making new projects. I'll update this page as I create new stuff over the years.</p>
