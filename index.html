		<h1>Hi, I'm Kaden.</h1>
		<p>(Also known as ex0planetary, or my old usernames epicdude312 and redyoshi857)</p>
		<p>I develop games and mods for games. Here's some of the stuff I've made over the years.</p>

		<h2>Duskbringer (2022-Present)</h2>
		<img alt="Duskbringer screenshot" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/272439946868948992/978700927315869756/unknown.png?width=1276&height=676" />
		<p>Duskbringer is a standalone game I've been making since I left the Minecraft modding scene in early 2022. It's a metroidvania inspired by games such as Hollow Knight, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Breath of the Wild, and Minecraft. You play as a lizard exploring a ruined kingdom carved into a giant tree.</p>
		<p>It's still early in development and not released yet but I'm quite proud of how it's coming along!</p>
		
		<h2>Minecraft Mods (2020-2022)</h2>
		<p>From 2020-2022 I was cofounder and lead developer of the Minecraft modding team Team Aurora. Over the years we racked up <b>over 17 million total downloads</b> making vanilla-styled mods. I did almost all of the programming for our mods, on top of a decent bit of game design and managing the team.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-mushrooms">Enhanced Mushrooms</a></h3>
		<img alt="Enhanced Mushrooms screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/317/494/2020-10-19_11.png" />
		<p>Enhanced Mushrooms adds a couple new wood types obtained from Minecraft's giant mushrooms, to make them more consistent with the Nether's mushrooms/fungi which have their own wood types. I did all of the game design for this mod, as well as the vast majority of the programming.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-badlands">Better Badlands</a></h3>
		<img alt="Better Badlands screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/324/54/2020-10-17_12.png" />
		<p>Better Badlands is a small mod that adds a few features to the Badlands biome. It contains a couple of blocks with unique properties, and a new small dark oak tree. A lot of the stuff in this mod was coded by me, although other team members did most of the code for the Thatch block.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bayou-blues">Bayou Blues</a></h3>
		<img alt="Bayou Blues screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/344/670/2021-02-16_20.png" />
		<p>Bayou Blues adds a new Bayou biome to the game. Apparently it was good enough that one of the most-downloaded mods of all time took inspiration from it and reworked their Bayou biome. Pretty cool I guess. I did all of the code for this one, and actually pumped out a large portion of the mod's code in a single day!</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/abundance">Abundance</a></h3>
		<img alt="Abundance screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/344/663/2021-03-01_14.png" />
		<p>Abundance is another biome mod that adds a couple of flower-related biomes. All of the code in the current patch as of March 2022 was written by me.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fruitful">Fruitful</a></h3>
		<img alt="Fruitful screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/370/61/2021-06-07_18.png" />
		<p>Fruitful is a little mod that was designed and coded entirely by me. The only part of it that I didn't do was the artwork. It was intended as an experiment to see if I could go from a problem (apples are annoying to farm) to a mod that solved that problem.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hanami">Hanami</a></h3>
		<img alt="Hanami screenshot" src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/307/879/2020-08-11_18.png" />
		<p>Hanami was a mod that added several different features based around a cherry blossom forest biome. I didn't do any of the game design for this one but I did all of the code. It was a lot of work and also is the one example I have of me coding entities! Sadly it was abandoned due to some internal strife within the team.</p>
		
		<h2><a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/platform-fighters">Platform Fighters</a> (2018)</h2>
		<img alt="Platform Fighters art" src="https://static.jam.vg/raw/27f/c/z/12440.png" />
		<p>Platform Fighters is a game I developed in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 41. It was made in C++ using the SFML library for graphics. Maybe doesn't quite hold up to the quality of my other projects but I made it in a short timeframe at age 14 so I'm pretty proud of how it turned out.</p>
		
		<h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/238822904/">Super Mario Scralaxy</a> (2018)</h2>
		<img alt="Super Mario Scralaxy screeenshot" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/272439946868948992/978697051237937222/unknown.png?width=901&height=676" />
		<p>Super Mario Scralaxy is a Mario fangame I was making in Scratch alongside some other users of the platform. It was the first game I worked on with a team. I only released one major version but implemented a whole load of new features into it, including a hub world and several new levels.</p>
		
		<h2><a href="https://talk.pokitto.com/t/making-a-minicraft-clone-blocky-world/420">Blocky World / Blockitto</a> (2017)</h2>
		<img alt="Blocky World gameplay" src="https://talk.pokitto.com/uploads/default/original/1X/20828c8751efc3a767815784bd3b5c78f807c138.gif" />
		<p>Blocky World, later renamed Blockitto, was a game I was developing for the Pokitto DIY console back in 2017. It was inspired by Notch's game Minicraft, and featured the ability to place and remove a variety of different tiles in a 2D top-down world. I eventually abandoned it after running into technical issues getting it to run on hardware, but it still gave me a lot of experience with building a sandbox game.</p>
		<p>(Ignore the low framerate in the GIF, I had to remove some frames to get this to upload back in the day! The actual game ran at a smooth 30 FPS.)</p>
		
		<h2><a href="https://talk.pokitto.com/t/game-arcade-classics-v1-0/413">Arcade Classics</a> (2017)</h2>
		<img alt="Arcade Classics gameplay" src="https://talk.pokitto.com/uploads/default/original/1X/610bccde0c617e69403f6126eedab462d9c28160.gif" />
		<p>Arcade Classics is another game I developed for the Pokitto. This one ended up actually getting released! It's a collection of a bunch of classic arcade-style games such as Pong, Breakout, and Snake. Runs on hardware too which is pretty neat.</p>
		
		<h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/168167028/">Mode 7 Engine</a> (2017)</h2>
		<img alt="Mode 7 Engine screenshot" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/272439946868948992/978697984151789618/unknown.png?width=904&height=676" />
		<p>Not necessarily a game but more of a demo. I developed a 3D rendering engine in Scratch inspired by Mode 7 on the SNES. It could render 3D terrain and place 2D billboard sprites on said terrain. The terrain itself didn't have depth-buffering but the billboard sprites did (although it was a bit buggy). Unfortunately updates to Scratch broke the triangle renderer a bit so it doesn't really work properly anymore.</p>
		
		<h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/91484856/">Yoshi's New Story</a> (2016)</h2>
		<img alt="Yoshi's New Story screenshot" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/272439946868948992/978699399561621544/unknown.png?width=900&height=676" />
		<p>Yoshi's New Story is a Yoshi fangame I made in Scratch at age 12. It features sidescrolling levels, a world map, (mostly) functional collision detection, enemies, etc. Probably the most impressive thing I ever did with Scratch and definitely the most popular.</p>
		
		<h2>More to come</h2>
		<p>I love programming and I'm often making new projects. I'll update this page as I create new stuff over the years.</p>
